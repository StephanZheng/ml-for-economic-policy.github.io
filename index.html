Machine learning offers enormous potential to transform our understanding of economics, economic decision making, and public policy. Yet its adoption by economists, social scientists, and policymakers remains nascent.

The goal of this workshop is to inspire and engage a broad interdisciplinary audience, including computer scientists, economists, and social scientists, around topics at the exciting intersection of economics, public policy, and machine learning.

This workshop will expose some of the critical socio-economic issues that stand to benefit from applying machine learning, expose underexplored economic datasets and simulations, and identify machine learning research directions that would have a significant positive socio-economic impact. In effect, we aim to accelerate the use of machine learning to rapidly develop, test, and deploy fair and equitable economic policies that are grounded in representative data.

For example, we would like to explore questions around whether machine learning can be used to help with the development of effective economic policy, to understand economic behavior through granular, economic data sets, to automate economic transactions for individuals, and how we can build rich and faithful simulations of economic systems with strategic agents. We would like to develop economic policies and mechanisms that target socio-economic issues including diversity and fair representation in economic outcomes, economic equality, and improving economic opportunity. In particular, we want to highlight both the opportunities as well as the barriers to the adoption of ML in economics.

Exemplar prior research includes the use of ML to analyze large economic datasets [Ruiz et al., 2017], to design optimal auctions [Dutting et al., 2017, Abernethy et al., 2019], using reinforcement learning to learn strong tax policies in AI-based economic simulations [Zheng et al., 2020], to provide insight into game-theoretic behavior [Wright and Leyton-Brown, 2017, Fudenberg and Liang, 2019], and to open up the study of social dilemmas [Leibo et al., 2017].

Best Paper Prizes
We will award two best paper prizes from the contributed works, sponsored by Salesforce. The two awards will recognize methodological and empirical contributions, respectively. Each best paper will be invited to give an oral presentation during the workshop.

Financial Support
We will also provide financial support (registration) for authors with accepted papers and speakers on a needs-based basis, sponsored by Salesforce. Weâ€™ll have a Google form for those interested to fill out and apply.

Submission Instructions
This workshop is non-archival. All accepted papers will be presented as virtual posters and invited to record 5-minute videos, with exceptional submissions also presented as 20-minute oral presentations. Submissions should not include already published machine learning work. Work that is in submission / under review is acceptable.

Up to 8 pages (excluding references), using the NeurIPS format.
Please do not include author information, submissions must be made anonymous.
Each paper should include a short declaration on the ethics and societal impact of the work.
Each paper should state the relevance of the work to the workshop. The organizers will desk-reject submissions that are not relevant to the workshop.
Each paper should state that the submitted work has not been published before and is original work.
Any papers found in violation of these rules will be rejected.
Accepted papers will be online 2 weeks before the day of the workshop.

We will employ a triple-blind reviewing system. Reviewers and organizers will not know the identity of the authors of submitted work. Only a designated external neutral party will have access to all author information.

Important Dates
Submission Deadline: October 2, 2020, 11:59 pm, Anywhere-on-Earth
Notification of Acceptance: October 30, 2020
Camera-ready Deadline for Accepted Papers: TBC
Workshop: December 11 or 12, 2020 (TBC)
